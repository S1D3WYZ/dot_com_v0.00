## Unwritten Rules

It can be tough trying to build a \[stream/channel/brand/community\], especially getting started from ground zero. I have been fortunate to be a part of some Great communities through the years, and would like to share some of my experiences and insights as  community member / mod / washed-up-lame-ex-content-creator on some approaches (and perceptions) regarding "networking" and establishing a brand/community.

Many streamers provide a "community stream" section in their Discord servers that allow their community to support each other, to try and ease the "getting started" part. It is an AWESOME feeling when we can help our friends and supporters get off the ground in return, and watch them develop. A wholesome cycle of positivity... the community supports the streamer, the streamer gives back to the community.

There are, however, some "unwritten rules" of ettiquette, one would be wise to consider when using these channels. I'm not the be-all, end-all authority on such matters, but I certainly have experienced having a positive opinion of some community members deteriorate by (ab)using them and wanted to serve up some morsels of mindfulness... while I do not think they're *bad people* , some of these *actions* make me lose all respect and interest in supporting/associating with these *behaviors*. 

If, in reading this, you feel "called out", it is not my intention to bag on any *body*, I *want* to see you succeed, but I also want to feel good about you succeeding... so I'd like to discuss a few actions that lessen my enthusiasm for supporing people. Hopefully avoiding these (or at least keeping in mind how they might be perceived) will help you along your journey & growth.

## Community Involvement

Most communities (worth being involved in) are very supportive of each other. Key words: **each other**! As a rule, you get out what you put in. Who knows, you might not get *as much* as you feel you put in, you might get *far more* than expected. But certainly, never EXPECT to get out more than you put in. Be part of them because you want to be part of them! Not because of you think it's a good place for promotion.

### Support the streamer and their community!

So, you want to grow your own amazing community, and feel some of the people from established communites might be a good fit. 

>OOOH! I know! Let's just "borrow" a bunch of them. I don't owe the streamer anything, right?

...not so fast, hotshot!

Why on earth would anybody want to support somebody who's only out for self? If you want their community to grow to like and support you, give them reason to!  There are many ways to support the streamer... most have their own pro's and pitfalls

### Donations are appreciated, never required

Obvious tip is obvious. You pay money/subs/bits/etc, streamer pays you attention. People see this generosity and think good thoughts about you. **But be wary**. It is *extremely* easy to pass the invisible line of "this person is really generous and awesome and I like them" into "this person is obviously out for attention... *look at meeeeee*" in both the Streamer and viewer/community's eyes. 

While some streamers DO rely on subs/bits/tips for their income, remember:
- NEVER give more than your DISPOSABLE income allows
- Unless they're a CHARITY, they accept TIPS not Donations
  - Tips are monetary expression of one's appreciation for service/content
  - Tips are NOT payments for goods/services
  - Tips are NOT investments
  - Being a generous member of a community can win you some good will, but does not **entitle** you to promos/shotouts
  - Being **perceived** as seeking (X) through tips can backfire quickly
  - Nobody thought Burger King tipping $5 to get an ~~~donation~~~ advertizement read aloud was a good idea. If you want to work out a promotion deal, that is for a private conversation off-stream


### Spend time generally involved with community

Time is fleeting. We all have busy lives. Best way to support streamers/communities is by being (a positive contribution) there. Yes, we have other commitments, and time slots may change, but find a way to involve yourself in the community without being transactional / directly getting something in return. IRL commitments make it so you can't hang out in stream as much as you'd like? That's understandable - but stay involved and keep in touch in non-promo Discord channels.

### Follow-For-Follow Doesn't Work!

> If I follow you, and you follow me, we have more followers! PROFFFITTTT!

 Posting your stream to a #promo channel that you don't otherwise visit or support - who else are you benefitting? Why would anybody else viewing or posting in that channel click on *your* announcement?

 Be warned: I also have seen this swing *too far* in the other direction as well. Very tight-knit groups of cross-promoters where everybody just cringes from a distance at all the circlar leg-humping ... not the best look either, from "outside" those small circles. 

 ## Community Crossover

 The internet is both a vast place and a small world - Community Crossover is a thing! The tips above work in a microcosm; your little panetoid to the bigger streamer's solar system. 
 
 But think ... bigger. 
 
 You might think of it as the light of stars reach out through a vast galaxy. Conversely, once you step back, you see... less minute detail, and more patterns & trends. Ones that you might or might not realize are becoming apparent.

 ### The Great Paradox

 > I keep posting I'm live in this Discord and nobody's joining (I may or may not be involved enough for them to want to, see above) ... **I KNOW!!!** I'll just post it to ALL the Discords I'm in, whether or not I participate in their community, it's more eyes on MEEE! Besides, its a promo channel, that's what it's there for! MEEE! (idk why nobody loves me, somebody love mee... plssss T_T)

Funny thing is, that while you might not get a bunch of traffic from (a) Discord community stream announcement, due to Community Crossover, what you've really done is probably annoy a good deal of them with redundant Notifications and "Notice me Senpai"'s. Regardless if you built up some good will in (a given/several) communit(y/ies) by organic involvement, when mass posting like this, they start no longer notice *"you, an awesome person, is streaming, let's support them"* and begin to realize *"this person is just promoting everywhere, I am not a valued person, I am a number to them"*

> 4th wall break / old man rant : I don't have hard numbers to back this up, and I'm just one onery old asshat. But  if I see your same Live announcement in more than 2 servers, theres a not small chance I will actively avoid your stream even if i might have potentially clicked. I won't pretend to speak for everybody, just saying might be wise to consider others might possibly share this opinion. Maybe not and i'm just weird? Who knows? We now return you to your regularly scheduled objective observations. 

### How to Maintain Cosmic Allignment

*I guess I'll stick with the metaphor? Leave me alone, my soapbox :p*

**Your** Discord should be the place for all your Going Live Announcements. People go to Your Discord to support YOU! You can't FORCE people to love/support you. Conversely; kinda pushes them away. Kinda like dating? You gotta have your own thing going for people to be interested in you. Actng all desperate / needy does not a good message send. 

*Guess we're moving metaphors. shaddup :p*

### Braggards v. Beggars

I suppose this could have gone with The Great Paradox but now is a good a time as any to address another one... As much as noone likes a braggard's "look at me", don't go *too* far past the "humble zone" and end up in "pity party town". 

> I'm almost affiliate, all I need is 4 more followers but I can only keep 1.3 viewers in stream... I need 5. Come watch me!

Actual Quote, not "hypothetical inner voice projection".

Oh, so you have nothing going for you, and you just want me to be a number in your "success"? I'm all for supporting people in their goals (and giving A/V, bot, broadcast & production tips) ...but... really? Is your (audio /gameplay /personality /interaction) *that* bad? Is there any hope my "charity" view would actually ... ***help???*** ...and be worth my emotional and time investment? Practice your craft and provide value! 

### "Big" streamers don't "GO LIVE" in 8 Discords

And you want to be "big". It's why you post everywhere. But maybe... (act like the big streamers) ...and don't.

## TL;DR

- Post in YOUR discord as you see fit, people signed up for that
  - I have a whole seperate rant on pings, for another day, moving on
- Post in (`max_one`) #promo channel per Stream
  - Provided you engage in that community organically, as advised above
  - NO MORE than ONCE per week in a given channel. 
  - "Special Events" can be an exception (charity/milestone/etc)
- DO NOT USE #PROMO WHILE THAT STREAMER IS LIVE
  - RUDE
  - YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD 
  - YOU SELFISH SELFISH SCUM OF A SOULLESS THIEF
  - "EXTREMELY Special Events" *might* maybe be an exception
    - Maybe... ask them... beforehand? 
    - If the event is SO Special ... you should know about it to give advance warning.
    - They might promo you instead of you "stealing their showtime"

I want to re-itterate, this post is not intended to "target" or "attack" any **body** or group ... I only wish to address **actions and behaviors** that conflict with my (and maybe others') desire to be supportive; to cause pause and thought, and to do so "in general" and avoid creating rifts in community. Because this isn't a witch hunt. Hopefully it's an opportunity for growth.

I don't have all the answers. Just shouting these grievances into the abyss: the rantings of a madman, for whomever can glean anything useful from it. Be it them, or you. I hope it helps somebody. 

So, yeah. That's all there really is to it. Just think "how would I feel if someone did this to me", and act like the decent Human I know you are.

Thanks for listening. :\) \<3

*I ask nothing in return, other than if you know somebody that might need to hear this, pass it on, spread the love*
